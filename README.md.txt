# üåç Arduino Environmental Alert System

This project uses an Arduino to monitor environmental conditions like **temperature** and **light**. It alerts you when:
- **Light levels drop too low** (simulating darkness or obstruction)
- **Temperature rises too high** (e.g. overheating)

## üß† Logic Overview

### üåô Light Detection (LDR)
- If ambient light drops below a certain analog threshold (`<= 400`), a buzzer and alert LED are activated.

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature Detection (NTC Thermistor)
- The NTC thermistor reduces its resistance as temperature rises.
- Analog value is read and converted to voltage, then to temperature in ¬∞C.
- If temperature exceeds 42¬∞C, a red LED and buzzer go off.
